# Registration Form

This project implements a simple registration form with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes form validation for username, password, birthday, email, and phone number. The password criteria are validated dynamically as the user types.

## Features

- **Username:** Validates that the username does not contain spaces.
- **Password:** Checks for at least 8 characters, one uppercase letter, one digit, and one special character.
- **Birthday:** Ensures the user selects a date.
- **Email:** Validates the email format (e.g., `example@example.com`).
- **Phone:** Requires a 10-digit phone number starting with `07`.
